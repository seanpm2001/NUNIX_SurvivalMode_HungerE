> _Part of the [:octocat: `NUNIX operating system project`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NUNIX/)_
> > _Part of the [:octocat: `NUNIX SurvivalMode core toolchain`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NUNIX_SurvivalMode/)_

## Summary

HungerE can act as a tool to remind the user when to eat, and also increase or decrease stimulation, causing more or less hunger. It is part of the SurvivalMode component toolchain of the NUNIX operating system.

## Developer notes

Despite its name, it is not written in the E programming language. It is not going to be written in E, as a pun shouldn't go that far in a critical component, especially since the E language wouldn't be of much use here. It will be written in C for portability and functionality.

## Name

The name is a pun off of the word `hungry` with the `ry` becoming `erE` (better explanation needed) the name was also made in reference to [`systemd`](https://systemd.io/) although not using thw word `system` , being 1 letter higher (`E`) and being stylized with capital letters on the front and back.
